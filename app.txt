Writing Prompts

many as you’d like with as much text as you’d like.

[TEXT WRITING_PROMPT_WALK OPTIONAL]
You're walking through the Elwynn woods; there's nobody around and you have no
torch or lantern. A sound creeks from behind you, like the snapping of a
branch. Out of the corner of your eye you spot a man in rags raising his hands
for your attention. He looks gaunt and has a disturbed glint in his eyes. What
do you do?

[TEXT WRITING_PROMPT_NIGHT_VISITOR OPTIONAL]
Your company has been deployed abroad and it is now the middle of the night;
you've been given night-watch duty and are the only one awake at the camp's
edge when an unnamed figure approaches. He is wearing tattered robes and tells
that he's been lost in the wilds for several weeks and now dearly requests for
a night to rest safely within your encampment. What do you do?

[TEXT WRITING_PROMPT_WOUNDED_DECISION OPTIONAL]
Your team has just finished fending off an ambush and several people are
wounded. Among the most grievously hurt is your company lieutenant, a field
medic, and a high-value civilian; each of them are unconscious. With very
limited supplies, what do you do?

[TEXT WRITING_PROMPT_FLOGGED_CIVILIAN OPTIONAL]
You see the sad sight of a civilian being flogged by an official. You do not

inflicting pain. A lord baron is observing the punishment as well. What do you
do?

[TEXT WRITING_PROMPT_PUNISHED_SOLDIER OPTIONAL]
A soldier is being reprimanded and will face severe punishment for something
that was <b>your</b> fault, but everyone, including the soldier, does not know
that. You do not know the soldier. What do you do?
